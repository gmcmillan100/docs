# Terminology

Programming: Giving a set of ordered instructions, in a language, to a computer
Class: It's the blueprint, the definition, the description
Object: It's created from the class
Statement: Use words, numbers, and punctuation to sent an instruction. Like a sentence in English. 
* CPU: It understands no programming languages. It understands only machine code running directly on hardware. (e.g., 00 6E 2F 65)
* Low level language: Runs near the CPU (e.g., Assembly, C)
* High level language: Runs far aware from the CPU (e.g., JavaScript, Python). Source code is translated from high level to low level.
* Integrated Development Environment (IDE): A professional development text editor (e.g, Eclipse, Xcode, VS)
* Compiled language: Uses a compiler to convert source code into machine code so it can run an executable file (e.g., Objective-C, C)
* Interpreted language: No compiler used. The source code is not compiled and built into an executable before it's run and consumed. A copy is given then run as-is by the other machine. (e.g., Python, JavaScript, PHP)
* Hybrid language: A combination of compiled code and intrepreted code (e.g., Java, Python)
* Integers: They are numbers, such as 0.
* Strings: They are characters and spaces, such as "This is an abc string"
