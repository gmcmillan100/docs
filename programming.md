# Terminology

Programming: Giving a set of ordered instructions, in a language, to a computer
Class: It's the blueprint, the definition, the description
Object: It's created from the class
Statement: Use words, numbers, and punctuation to sent an instruction. Like a sentence in English. 
CPU: It understands no programming languages. It understands only machine code running directly on hardware. (e.g., 00 6E 2F 65)
Low level language: Runs near the CPU (e.g., Assembly, C)
High level language: Runs far aware from the CPU (e.g., JavaScript, Python). Source code is translated from high level to low level.
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): A professional development text editor (e.g, Eclipse, Xcode, VS)
Compiled language: Uses a compiler to convert source code (Python) into machine code so it can run an executable file (e.g., Objective-C, C)
Interpreted language: No compiler used. The source code is not compiled before it's consumed. A copy is given then run as-is by the other machine. (e.g., JavaScript, PHP)
Hybrid language: A combination of compiled code and intrepreted code (e.g., Java, Python)
