# Managers

## Good Ones

Leadership. The ability to inspire others to achieve a shared objective. ~ Jeff Weiner.

A bad manager can take a good staff and destroy it, causing the best employees to flee and the remainder to lose all motivation. ~ Peter Drucker

Good managers are magnets of talent. Bad managers are repellents of it.

Eleven Signs Your Job Doesn't Deserve You:

1) Your boss is micro-managing you and your decisions

2) They do not give you credit for your work

3) Your boss does not give you enough feedback and guidance

4) Your boss has little interest in what you are doing, or worse avoids you

5) You are underpaid

6) You are not learning anything new

7) Your boss is not aware of what you are capable of

8) Your health is suffering because of stress

9) You can not remember when was the last time your boss thanked you

10) You dedication, hard work, loyalty are not appreciated

11) The real deal-breaker is when your boss lacks integrity. Integrity is by far the most important asset of a leader.

Go where you are celebrated, not just tolerated.

Go where you can make a difference.

Go where your loyalty and hard work will be appreciated.

## Google Spent a Decade Researching What Makes a Great Boss. They Came Up With These 10 Things

"People leave managers, not companies."

We've all heard it. Many of us have experienced it. But what makes people want to leave a manager in the first place? And if you happen to lead a team, what qualities can make you better?

Those are the types of questions Google set out to answer. In 2008, they began research into what makes a good manager, code-named Project Oxygen. They originally identified eight behaviors that were common among their highest performing managers, and began training all managers to develop those behaviors. Over time, Google saw a marked improvement in key metrics such as employee turnover, satisfaction, and performance.

But as the company grew, the demands on managers also increased. Google continued their research. They refined it. They learned more.

"We found that, over time, the qualities of a great manager at Google had grown and evolved with along with the company," wrote Melissa Harrell and Lauren Barbato earlier this year. Harrell works as a staffing services manager and Barbato as a people analyst. 

After taking a second look at its research, Google then "refreshed [its] behaviors according to internal research and Google and [employee] feedback, and put them to the test."

This resulted in a new list, identifying two completely new behaviors (Nos. 9 and 10) and updating two others (Nos. 3 and 6).

Here are the 10 behaviors of Google's best managers, along with some practical tips on how to develop these behaviors. (You can find more detailed advice on developing your management skills in my new book, EQ Applied: The Real-World Guide to Emotional Intelligence.)

1. Is a good coach
A good coach avoids the trap of solving every problem for their team as soon as it arises. 

Rather they use these problems as teaching moments. They guide and share insights at the right time, letting their team gain valuable experience along the way.

2. Empowers team and does not micromanage
Everybody hates a micromanager. In contrast, a good team lead gives their people enough freedom--to explore new ideas, to experiment, and to develop (and adapt) their own working style.

In addition, great managers make sure their people have the tools and flexibility they need to do their jobs.

3. Creates an inclusive team environment, showing concern for success and well-being
Great managers make it a priority to build trust in their teams.

As Google puts it:

In a team with high psychological safety, teammates feel safe to take risks around their team members. They feel confident that no one on the team will embarrass or punish anyone else for admitting a mistake, asking a question, or offering a new idea.

(More on how to build this type of environment here.)

4. Is productive and results-oriented
The best managers make those around them better.

They realize what their teams are capable of, and they use emotional intelligence to motivate their people and help them realize their potential.

5. Is a good communicator--listens and shares information
Great managers are great listeners--this enables understanding. They also share what they can, realizing transparency is beneficial for the team as a whole.

They share sincere and specific praise, early and often. But they also don't hold back from giving necessary (negative) feedback--making sure to frame it in a way that is constructive and easy to learn from.

6. Supports career development and discusses performance
Great managers are invested in their people. They provide career path options, realizing not everyone wants to follow the same road. 

They also don't hold their people back for personal gain. Rather, they support team members and help them to reach their goals.

7. Has a clear vision/strategy for the team
Great managers know where they're going, but they make sure the whole team knows, too--rather than keeping them in the dark.

They are also careful to communicate "scope," realistic expectations as to what specific actions are needed to execute a strategy, and each team member's role in delivering.

8. Has key technical skills to help advise the team
Great bosses understand a job well and are skilled at the work they oversee. 

If an effective manager is brought into a new department, they take time in the beginning to familiarize themselves with their people's everyday work and challenges. This earns them the respect of their team.

9. Collaborates across [the company]
Some managers create silos, running their teams with an "us versus them" mentality, competing against other teams within the company.

Great managers have the ability to see the big picture, and work for the good of a company as a whole.

10. Is a strong decision maker
Great managers take the lead. They make the tough decisions, and make sure everyone understands the reasons behind those decisions.

Then, they commit to following through.

Of course, the first step--identifying effective manager behaviors (and tips for developing them)--is easy. Execution is the hard part.

But it's managers like these that will help your people--and your company--accomplish great things.



# Values

Our Values are the principles we use to run the company on a daily
basis. They’re so important, in fact, that they’re the source of our
entire Code, policies, and other guidelines—a sort of ethical
backbone.

## OUR MEMBERS COME FIRST
We encourage employees to know and understand our members and to
ensure that we foster the long-term vitality of the Company
ecosystem.

## RELATIONSHIPS MATTER
By fostering trust with colleagues and partners, we all succeed. We
fundamentally believe that doing what is right is more important than
being right. We manage compassionately by recognizing that people have
experiences and perspectives that may differ from our own. We put
ourselves in the shoes of others before drawing conclusions.

## BE OPEN, HONEST, AND CONSTRUCTIVE
We expect our employees to communicate with clarity and provide
feedback with consistency in a constructive way.

## DEMAND EXCELLENCE
Our employees are encouraged to lead by example, seek to solve big
challenges, set measurable and actionable goals, and continuously
learn, iterate, and improve.

## TAKE INTELLIGENT RISKS
Taking intelligent risks has been paramount in building the company to
date. No matter how large we become, we strive to never lose our
startup mentality.

## ACT LIKE AN OWNER
Talent is our most important asset. We expect our employees to act as
an owner in each decision they make, no matter how big or small.

# Our Culture

Our Culture is the framework that allows our Values to thrive. Our
Culture comes out in all that we do. It’s a way of being. It’s
engrained in our vocabulary.

As we continue to grow our business around the world, we need to stay
true to our Culture and Values which have shaped our company thus far.

These are the main tenets of our Culture.

## Transformation

People who work at Company are here because they seek to make a
positive and lasting impact on the world, help realize the full
potential of Company, and fundamentally alter the trajectory of their
careers.

## Results

We set clear, actionable goals and have high expectations for our performance.

We count on our employees to consistently deliver excellent results,
seek leverage through greater efficiency and effectiveness, and
demonstrate leadership throughout the organization.

## Integrity

We don’t believe the ends justify the means.

Rather, we expect employees to do the right thing no matter what.

## Collaboration

Much like the network effects inherent in our business model, we
believe that as valuable as we are as individuals, we are all
exponentially more valuable when aligned and working together.


## Humor

Fulfilling our mission and vision requires an intense focus, so we
believe it is important to not take ourselves too seriously and try to
have some fun while doing it.


# Retaliation

Imagine you reported bullying by your manager or colleague, only to
find that they subsequently spread rumors about you or ensured you
were excluded from key meetings or networking events.

What if you were called as a witness in a discrimination suit against
your employer and were later overlooked for a promotion? What should
you do? What protection would you have?

Retaliation occurs when an employer takes some "adverse action"
against an employee for undertaking some "protected activity" (such as
speaking up about or opposing a discriminatory practice or about some
other conduct the employee reasonably believes to be unlawful) or
takes some adverse action to try to keep an employee from undertaking
a protected activity.

## What is a Protected Activity?

Participation in an employment discrimination proceeding is a
protected activity. Participation is a protected activity even if the
proceeding involved claims that ultimately were found to be invalid.

Examples of participation include:

Filing a charge of employment discrimination
Cooperating with an internal investigation of alleged discriminatory practices
Serving as a witness in an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
(EEOC) investigation or litigation

A protected activity can also include requesting a reasonable
accommodation based on religion or disability.

## What is an Adverse Action?

Retaliation in the workplace can include a broad range of "adverse
actions"—such as firing, demotion, reduction in salary, harassment, or
any other action that adversely and materially impacts an employee’s
job performance or career opportunity—in payback or retribution for
reporting an issue, raising a concern, or even just cooperating with
an investigation of someone else’s complaint.

Retaliation can also take subtler forms of adverse action, such as an
unexpectedly poor performance review, being abruptly excluded from an
ongoing project, or suddenly being micromanaged on every task without
adequate justification.

Adverse actions do not include petty slights and annoyances, such as
isolated negative comments in an otherwise positive or neutral
evaluation, or negative comments that are justified by an employee's
poor work performance or history.

Actions affecting employment such as threats, unjustified negative evaluations, unjustified negative references, or increased surveillance are examples of adverse action.

If an employee’s terms or conditions of employment are materially
impacted, then the action taken against them is considered adverse.

## Never Acceptable

Our company has a zero-tolerance policy on retaliation and takes
seriously concerns and claims about such activity. Retaliation not
only violates our company policy and our culture, it is also against
the law.

Retaliation is never acceptable and will be addressed with serious
consequences. You have a legal and ethical responsibility to guard
against this inappropriate workplace conduct, and you should escalate
any concerns of retaliation so that they can be addressed
appropriately. Our company takes seriously any allegations of
retaliation and will investigate and address these claims swiftly.

You should also feel free to raise concerns about any practice or
conduct you believe to be wrong, without the fear of retribution for
doing so, knowing that the company will not tolerate retaliatory
behavior for you having raised your concern.

## Examples

Abigail. "In my last company I filed a complaint against my manager.
She was discriminating against me because of my religion. She was
disciplined for this. However, a year later I was in line for a
promotion. I was the most qualified candidate but my manager promoted
someone less qualified instead." Employment actions such as
termination, refusal to hire, and denial of promotion are all examples
of adverse action.

Pedro. "In a previous job, a colleague of mine filed a complaint
against the company for sexual harassment. Up until he filed the
complaint, he never received a negative performance evaluation.
However, ever since he filed the complaint he began to receive
unjustified negative evaluations and was even threatened with
termination by one of his managers." Actions affecting employment such
as threats, unjustified negative evaluations, unjustified negative
references, or increased surveillance are examples of adverse action.

Lucia. "A friend of mine at another company has been really stressed
lately. Her boss regularly shouts at her in meetings and has verbally
abused her on numerous occasions. I told her that she should file a
harassment complaint as it sounds like her boss has created a hostile
work environment for her. Her boss found out from someone in HR that
my friend was considering filing a complaint. He then threatened my
friend that he would implicate her in a civil case that the company
was defending and that she'd be charged and have to appear in court."
Any other action such as an assault or unfounded civil or criminal
charges that are likely to deter reasonable people from pursuing their
rights is considered an adverse action.

Yeo. "I heard of a case where someone started a new job and when their
new employer discovered that they were pursuing an Equal Employment
Opportunity (EEO) charge against their previous employer, they decided
to terminate the employee's contract."

## Covered Individual

This is also an example of an adverse action. Even if the prior
protected activity alleged wrongdoing by a different employer,
retaliatory adverse actions are unlawful.

In the context of retaliation, a "covered individual" (in the context
of discrimination and harassment claims) is any employee who has
opposed unlawful practices, participated in proceedings, or requested
accommodations related to employment discrimination based on a
protected class. Covered individuals may bring their claims to the US
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or the relevant state
agency, in addition to raising their concerns internally with the
company.

Individuals who have a close association with someone who has engaged
in such protected activity also are covered individuals. For example,
it is illegal to terminate an employee because his spouse participated
in employment discrimination litigation.

Individuals who have brought attention to violations of law other than
employment discrimination, although not covered specifically by the
EEO laws, are still covered by the company’s anti-retaliation policy
and may have additional protections under other federal and state
laws.

## Remember

If you witness harassment or discrimination, you should report what
you see and hear without fear of retaliation.

Any targeted actiontaken in response to being reported may be
considered an act of retaliation.

But an individual is within their rights to report a colleague if the
colleague was involved in an incident, even if that colleague had
previously filed a complaint against the individual.

Remember, it’s important that you are able to recognize the actions
that may be considered retaliation that may follow reporting a
colleague.

Can recognize retaliation that may follow reporting a colleague.
Know the actions that may be considered retaliation.
Can appropriately respond to and report retaliation.

# Discrimination

Discrimination refers to unequal or unfair treatment of an individual
or a group based on certain characteristics protected by federal
and/or state law.

## What is Discrimination?

When Harumi realized that her physical disability was preventing her
promotion to senior management, she wasn’t just hurt. She felt like
her entire career had been a lie.

Kenneth couldn’t believe it when he heard his colleague use a racial
slur. He’d always thought his office was a respectful environment.

When Ernesto overheard his boss say that he wouldn't consider Ernesto
for a promotion because he was 55, he was devastated. He had an
excellent service record for the 15 years he'd worked for the company,
and now he was being passed over for promotion because of his age.

Deepa was shocked when she discovered that her religion mattered more
to her boss than her performance did. A colleague told her that her
boss has said he was looking to transfer her to another team because
he didn't like working with people 'like her.'

Discrimination is never acceptable.

You have a legal, moral, and ethical responsibility to guard against
this inappropriate workplace conduct.

## Laws of Enforcement

The primary federal law prohibiting discrimination in the workplace is
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Many states have developed similar statutes over time, deriving much
of the underlying protections from Title VII.

EEOC, The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is
responsible for preventing unlawful employment practices by employers,
unions, and employment agencies.

To achieve its goal, the EEOC accepts and investigates charges of
discrimination filed by or on behalf of individuals claiming to have
been subjected to an unlawful employment practice on the basis of a
protected class, including but not limited to race, color, religion,
sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older),
disability, or genetic information.

State-Specific Laws. Some states have additional protected classes.
The EEOC enforces numerous federal anti-discrimination laws, like
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act, the Equal Pay Act, and portions of the Americans with
Disabilities Act.

Make sure you are aware of any state-specific laws that may affect
your professional conduct.

## Remember

It is unlawful to discriminate against any individual or group in
regard to recruiting, hiring and promotion, transfer, work
assignments, performance measurements, the work environment, job
training, discipline and discharge, wages and benefits, or any other
term, condition, or privilege of employment on the basis of the
individual or group’s protected class or classes.

If a day off has been approved, and the circumstances change, it may
sometimes be necessary to ask an employee to work.

Religious accommodation laws allow employers to engage in discussion
about these kinds of issues.

Employees with sincerely held religious beliefs will be accommodated
where possible.

Always select the bestcandidate for the position. An individual’s
pregnancy cannot affect your decision.

Remember, it is never acceptable to discriminate against anyone
because of pregnancy.

Remember, you cannot decide against promoting or hiring someone
because they are too old.

It’s important that you:

Can identify discrimination in the workplace.
Understand the different types of discrimination and protected classes.
Know when a person is being discriminated against.

# Harassment

It can sometimes be difficult to determine when harassment becomes
discrimination as this can be a somewhat confusing topic. We've tried
to simplify it here by looking at what harassment includes and when
harassment becomes actionable.

## What Does Harassment Include?
Depending on the circumstances, harassment may include conduct such as
stereotyped or demeaning remarks or gestures; bullying; or the display
or circulation, whether in writing or electronically, of materials or
pictures offensive to persons because of their race, religion, creed,
color, citizenship, national origin, age, sex, gender
identity/expression, sexual orientation, marital status, disability,
genetic information, veteran status, or any other legally protected
basis, in accordance with applicable federal, state, or local law.

## When Does Harassment Become Actionable?

Harassment is actionable as discrimination in violation of the law
when the conduct becomes “so severe or pervasive as to alter the
conditions of the employee’s employment and create an abusive working
environment.”

## Remember…

The main factors to consider, when trying to determine if someone's
jokes could be considered harassment, are whether or not the person
making the jokes intends them to be hurtful and whether or not the
target perceives the jokes as hurtful.

Remember, even if someone doesn't intend any harm, if the target of
the jokes, or those who witness them, are hurt or offended by the
jokes and this is happening on a regular basis, this could create a
hostile work environment for them and could be considered harassment.

Employees shouldn'tuse their company email account to send risqué
jokes to colleagues.

A constant stream of emails with jokes on religion and sexuality risk
offending some colleagues.

Remember, jokes that offend some colleagues could contribute to an
offensive, hostile work environment.

Remember that intent and perception are key to determining if a
statement could be considered harassment. If either Lee or Carlos
voiced discomfort with the situation, Imani might need to reconsider,
but there is no red flag for harassment here.

It’s important that you:

Understand what can constitute harassment in the workplace.
Know when a person is being harassed.
Know what to do if you are the victim, or if you witness harassment.

# Bullying

You may think that workplace bullying is rare, but according to a
recent survey, approximately 30% of workers have current or past
direct experience with abusive work conduct.

Here we pride ourselves on our inclusive and respectful working
environment. If you or a colleague experience behavior that undermines
your dignity, you have a duty to do something about it.

## What Is Bullying?

Workplace bullying can take many forms and doesn’t need to involve
physical violence. It may be a manager shouting abuse at a team
member, or someone spreading malicious rumors behind a colleague’s
back. Bullying is any repeated, health-harming mistreatment of one or
more persons (the targets) by one or more perpetrators.

It can be verbal abuse or any abusive conduct that threatens,
humiliates, or intimidates. It is work interference – sabotage – which
prevents work from getting done.

Humiliation, exclusion, threats, yelling, use of profanity, and
intimidation are all forms of bullying.

## Examples

Undermining a colleague’s work
Threatening physical abuse
Withholding necessary information to help a colleague succeed or
giving wrong information to a colleague on purpose
Spying on or pestering someone
Assigning an unreasonable workload to a single person or group of
people (not based on a protected class)
Yelling or using profanity
Creating a sense of uselessness
Persistently criticizing a colleague or constantly humiliating a colleague
Belittling a colleague’s opinions or tampering with a colleague’s equipment
Unwarranted or undeserved punishment

## If You Are a Victim…

If you feel that you are the victim of bullying, such as physical
violence or verbal abuse, you should report it immediately.

## Subtle Forms of Bullying…

If you experience more subtle forms of bullying, such as exclusion
from a group that you should be part of, approach your manager and
raise the issue.

## Examples

* Justine. “My line manager singled me out for criticism almost every
day. I lost confidence and started to perform badly, so she criticized
me even more!
Eventually, I plucked up courage to report her behavior. I was moved
to a different team and now I’m thriving!”

* Anton. “Two colleagues used to criticize my dress sense. When I became
upset, they said, “Hey, can’t you take a joke?” I became so unhappy, I
resigned. My manager begged me to stay. I was his highest performer,
but I’d had enough. Where I work now, we respect each other.”

* Hana. “My manager pushed a female team member against a wall because
she questioned him in public. The victim was scared to report the
manager’s behavior, but the rest of the team encouraged her to and
supported her claim. Disciplinary measures were taken against the
manager and he was later dismissed.”

* Aanisah. “I joined a well-established team; they didn’t want a
newcomer bringing new ideas. I was excluded from meetings and
discussions. My ideas were dismissed as worthless. I suffered from
stress and spent months off work. I wish I’d reported their behavior
before it affected my health.”

* Khalilah. “My manager treated me less favorably than my peer, and
allowed her to take credit for work I’d done. When a new opportunity
for promotion came up, my manager told me not to apply as my peer was
in line for the position.”

* Larry. “Someone at work was sending me insulting messages. I was
afraid to look at my phone. My productivity plummeted. I never
discovered who conducted the hate campaign, as I was too embarrassed
to report the problem. Whoever it was might be doing the same thing to
my replacement right now.”

## Remember

Constant public criticism can have an adverse effect on confidence and
may cause someone to be less engaged in group activities or team
meetings.

Bullying doesn’t always involve raised voices or threats of violence.
It can take the form of repeated criticism, or even non-verbal actions
such as aggressive body language. Exclusion is also a form of
bullying.
The impact of bullying in the workplace is detrimental to the whole
organization. It affects our working culture and means we risk losing
talent.
Always report instances of bullying. Bullying is never acceptable, and
we are committed to ensuring that it doesn’t happen here!

## Agreement

I have read our anti-harassment and discrimination policies.
I will follow all policies related to anti-harassment and
discrimination at all times.
I will report any instances of harassment or discrimination that I
witness or am subject to.
I will not partake in any form of harassment, discrimination,
bullying, or retaliation.

# Workplace Diversity and Inclusion

What does an inclusive workplace look like?

It’s a welcoming culture in which everyone is treated with respect and
dignity – and everyone feels valued.

## Include everyone

“I understand that everybody has a point of view. I am willing to
learn, accept feedback, and listen.

Making sure that everyone is included has helped us come up with
fantastic business solutions.”

## Take time to learn

“I take time to learn about my colleagues’ races, religions, cultures,
and backgrounds. I welcome ideas that are different and see how
problems can be viewed from different points of view.

It makes work more interesting and fun.”

## Participate

“Being familiar with the company’s diversity policies helps me to
implement them. I volunteer, chair, or serve on the committees that
organize diversity-related events in the company and the wider
community.”

## Broaden your horizons

“I try to treat people in the way they wish to be treated. Engaging
with our mixed global culture and being part of it will broaden my
horizons and make our place of work a better place to be.”

## Flexibility

Diversity comes from our age, race, ethnic group, nationality,
national origin, gender, sexuality, religion and beliefs, and
cultures. Each of us brings something unique to the workplace.

Remember that social activities and practices that are comfortable for
you may not be for everyone, and vice versa.

Daren shouldn’t have to go against his personal beliefs, and he
certainly shouldn’t feel he has to lie to his colleagues to fit in.
It’s okay to decline an invitation, but even better to suggest an
alternative that would see Daren meet his colleagues on common ground.

It’s important to:

Open yourself to the ideas, cultures, backgrounds, and beliefs of others.
Be aware that people coming from cultural backgrounds different than
our own can feel distanced or excluded.
Remember to treat others as you would like to be treated yourself.

## Being Sensitive

While we encourage open, honest, and constructive conversations at
Company, you always need to be mindful that this doesn’t mean that
you can say exactly what you want all the time. Always remember that
not everyone will share the same opinions as you.

It's important to remember that in some cases you may say something
hurtful without meaning to be hurtful, but another party may be hurt
by what you have said. Sometimes, in situations like this, the person
that made the hurtful comment believes the offended party should not
have been hurt by the comment because they didn't intend to be
hurtful. You should always consider how a comment will be perceived.

As a manager, you should consider how you can encourage open, honest,
and constructive conversation in line with our values, while avoiding
heated discussions and/or causing offense with personal opinions.

# Diversity

Diversity in the workplace means harnessing the differences between us
for our own good and for the good of the company.

We all want to work in an environment in which we feel valued and
where our individual talents are recognized and utilized. Our business
performance is enhanced by learning from the varied perspectives,
backgrounds, and experiences of our colleagues.

Innovative ideas and solutions to challenging issues can come from
seeking input from those whose perspectives are different from our
own.

## Strength

Diversity makes us stronger as a company and helps provide a better
place to work. Diversity has a large part to play in our performance
and motivation.

We are committed to upholding diversity principles to build a better workplace.

## Support

We each have a responsibility to support and contribute to a diverse workplace.

Diversity provides a workplace with creativity, motivation,
innovation, and success, but only if we all make an effort to
recognize the individual talents and experiences that each of us
brings to work.

## Commitment

Commit your time and energy to the effort. You might volunteer to
serve on a diversity-related committee, or become part of a
co-mentoring relationship.

Ask committee chairs and other company leaders where they see
opportunities for you to help.

## Competency

Take the time to actively learn about the different cultures, races,
experiences, and backgrounds of your colleagues.

Become familiar with diversity-related terminology, and look for
common ground first, not differences. Welcome new ideas and a wide
array of perspectives.

## Improvement

It takes time and patience to commit to diversity and you may make
mistakes along the way.

Be willing to learn, graciously accept feedback, and listen to your
colleagues. You can always find opportunities to grow and be better.

## Remember

It’s important that every member of the team is supporting and
contributing to workplace diversity.

Remember to treat your colleagues as individuals, regardless of
religion or cultural background.

It takes time and patience to commit to diversity in the workplace.
Grasp the opportunity to learn – it’s all part of your cultural
growth.

Diversity makes us stronger as a company and helps provide a better
place to work.
You have a responsibility to support, contribute, and commit to uphold
the principles to build a better workplace.
You should take the time to actively learn about the different
cultures, races, and backgrounds of your colleagues. Become familiar
with diversity-related terminology, and look for similarities first,
not differences.

# Gender Identity

Gender identity is a person's inner sense of their own gender.

Gender can be expressed through one's dress, grooming, mannerisms,
speech patterns, or social interaction.

## Gender identity discrimination

Shinzo is now clear that individuals can't allow their personal
feelings on sexual orientation to influence decisions in the
workplace.

Remember, you cannot treat individuals differently because of their
sexual orientation or preference. The members of Shinzo's team may be
entitled to their personal opinions but Shinzo can't let them
interfere with his decision.

In a situation like this, if the offer was withdrawn, Jack would have
a very strong case for discrimination based on sexual orientation.

We're relying on you to help keep our workplace free from harassment
and discrimination.

You have a responsibility to report any instances of sexual harassment
or discrimination that you witness.

## Gender reassignment

When someone at work goes through a gender transition, it’s important
to have in-person training with the employee's managers and the
colleagues who work directly with the transitioning employee.

Here, management has an opportunity not only to provide education on
transgender issues, but also to reinforce their expectations of
workplace fairness for all employees.

# Sexual Harassment

Have you ever felt uncomfortable in your workplace? Was it because of
a colleague’s inappropriate behavior towards you or another colleague?

Sexual harassment occurs when someone is subjected to unwanted sexual
advances, petitioned for sexual favors, or physically/verbally abused.

Harassment doesn’t have to be of a sexual nature – it can include
offensive remarks about a person’s sex. For example, you could be
guilty of harassing a man if you make offensive comments about men in
general.


Simple teasing or offhand comments might be allowed, but harassment is
illegal when it creates a hostile or offensive work environment.

## Types of

Sexual harassment may involve various forms of verbal and physical
conduct, of both a sexual or non-sexual nature, which have the purpose
or effect of creating a hostile or offensive work environment.

## What is

What Constitutes Sexual Harassment?
Although many sexual harassment cases are brought by female plaintiffs
alleging conduct by a male colleague or supervisor, such claims can
also involve harassment of male employees by female supervisors or
colleagues, same sex harassment, or claims that the environment was
hostile for male and female employees alike.

The conduct need not consist solely of lewd acts, sexual innuendos, or
sexual advances. It is enough that the conduct, whether blatant or
subtle, discriminates against a person on the basis of his or her
gender/sex.

Verbal Harassment
Offering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors,
descriptions of people, commentary on bodies, sexually degrading words
used to describe people, jokes, name calling, repeatedly asking
someone on a date when they have said they are not interested,
whistling, or catcalling.

Non-Verbal (Visual) Harassment
Unwanted or offensive emails, texting, websites, blog posts, or other
social media; displaying suggestive objects, pictures, cartoons or
posters, obscene notes, letters, or invitations.

Physical Harassment
Gestures, touching, blocking people’s way, massages, head petting or
stroking, standing too close, or purposely brushing up on someone.

Teasing and Offhand Comments
Depending on the impact on the individual, simple teasing or offhand
comments might fall outside legal guidelines, but harassment is always
illegal when it creates a hostile or offensive work environment.

## Sexual Harassment Guidelines

Does It Have to Be Sexual?
“I was new to my team and heard people making lewd comments about my
sexuality. Could this be considered sexual harassment?”

Sexual harassment doesn’t necessarily mean a sexual advance. Comments
about sexuality can be considered sexual harassment.

Who’s Impacted?
“I can’t be a victim of sexual harassment because I’m a man, right?”

Anyone in the workplace can be the victim or harasser, regardless of sex.

## Law

What Does the Law Say?
“Could I get legal help if I feel I’m being sexually harassed?”

The law protects you, especially if the harassment is so severe it
creates a hostile work environment. Simple teasing, offhand comments,
or isolated incidents may fall outside legal guidelines, but
harassment is always illegal when it creates a hostile or offensive
work environment.

## What is a Hostile Environment

What Is a Hostile Environment?
“I don’t know what makes a hostile working environment; could mine be
considered hostile?”

Oftentimes, employees believe that a bad boss, a rude colleague, a
lack of perks, or an unpleasant work environment is “hostile.” The
reality is that in order for a workplace to be considered hostile,
certain legal criteria must be met.

Such criteria include: (1) whether the conduct was unwelcome; (2)
whether such conduct was based on a protected class; and (3) whether
such conduct was so severe or pervasive as to alter the conditions of
the victim’s employment and create an abusive work environment.

## Quid Pro Quo

What Is Quid Pro Quo?
“What type of harassment is Quid Pro Quo?”

Quid pro quo sexual harassment typically involves a person in
authority requesting sexual favors in return for a positive employment
action. This is never acceptable behavior.

## Transgender

Are There Specific Laws to Protect Transgender People?
"What laws are in place to protect transgender people?"

Although the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
provides equal protection under the law for all, there is no federal
law designating transgender as a protected class, or specifically
requiring equal treatment for transgender people. However, many states
have passed legislation to protect the employment rights of
transgender employees.

## Parties Outside Work

Remember, just because an employee is not at work, they may not engage
in inappropriate conduct that would otherwise be impermissible in the
workplace itself.

This type of after-hours behavior has the same effect as if it had
occurred on work premises during regular work hours.

## Comments

Remember, offensive comments about a person’s sexuality are
harassment, even if the victim doesn’t hear.

You should always report such incidents.

## Dating / Promotions

Holly is under no obligation to appoint Dave and is only selecting the
best candidate for the department.

If Holly can show solid reasons for not appointing Dave, then he does
not have a case for sexual harassment.

Steve’s actions could constitute harassment because the conduct is
unwelcome and it has unreasonably interfered with Ben’s work.

Otto’s conduct may be considered harassment if it is unwelcomed and it
makes Aung uncomfortable.

Remember, it’s important that you:

Can identify sexual harassment in the workplace.
Know what to do when you witness or experience it.

# Anti-Corruption

Our commitment to integrity means we always want to source the best candidate through our normal hiring process. Hiring a customer’s family member, friend, or anyone else to influence a decision can be a form of bribery, which is completely at odds with our mission of creating economic opportunity for everyone. We can’t create a positive, lasting impact on the world if we let corruption play a part in our business operations.

We don’t bribe. It’s that simple. When confronted with these situations, immediately reach out to integrity@linkedin.com.

If you think that hiring someone might violate our Global Anticorruption policy, disclose the situation immediately. Don’t suggest to our partners or suppliers that they should hire the applicant either.

We believe in meritocracy. All applicants, no matter who they are, need to go through our normal hiring process. If you’re concerned about a hiring request, visit go/integrity to get help and report the concern.

# Privacy and Customer Data

Our members and customers trust us with their personal information, and we have a responsibility to protect it. We’re open and honest with them about how we use their data, and we certainly never change how we’re using member information without getting consent first. Our Privacy Policy and the terms and conditions of any agreements we have with our customers govern how we handle personal information and customer data. We honor these commitments.
