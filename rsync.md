# To do

- rsync without ssh and user account login
- create cron script
- digest http://rsync.samba.org/examples.html
- On WD etc/rsyncd.conf, why is path = /shares/rsync/foo ignored (not working)?. Instead the dest path is specified on the command line.

# Enable rsync daemon on Nassua

1. SSH into the server as root:

	```
	ssh root@192.168.1.105
	password: welc0me
	```

2. On the server, create the /etc/rsync.conf and put this in it:

	```
	motd file = /etc/rsyncd.motd                                                    
	log file = /var/log/rsyncd.log                                                  
	pid file = /var/run/rsyncd.pid                                                  
	lock file = /var/run/rsync.lock                                                 
	                                                                                
	[mypath]                                                              
	path = /DataVolume/rsync                                                        
	comment = My Very Own Rsync Server                                              
	uid = nobody                                                                    
	gid = nobody                                                                    
	read only = no                                                                  
	list = yes                                                                      
	auth users = username                                                           
	secrets file = /etc/rsyncd.scrt    
	```       

3. Start the daemon. Must be root.

	```
	rsync --daemon
	```

See the log:


	```
	more /var/log/rsyncd.log 
	2010/03/18 22:51:51 [15499] rsyncd version 3.0.2 starting, listening on port 873
	```

4. Create a user account named "rsync" with password "rsync" on the WD. In finder, had to connect to "Nassau" as user "rsync" in order to see sub folders in "rsync" account.

	```
	/usr/bin/rsync
	```

# Running

1. From the client, run rsync:

	```
	$ rsync --verbose --progress --stats --recursive --times --perms --delete /usr/home/greg/docs/ rsync@192.168.1.105:/DataVolume/rsync

2. Verify on Nassau

	```
	$ cd /DataVolume/rsync/
	$ ls -al apache.txt 
	-rwxrwxrwx    1 rsync    jewab        1872 Jan 23 22:14 apache.txt
	```
