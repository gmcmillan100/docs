 Rehash and verify that the new packages are present on my system:

```
greg-pc# rehash
greg-pc# which netscape
/usr/local/bin/netscape
```

I use "rehash" because if I'm using cshell, which I probably am,
it remembers certain things about how to find files. When
something new gets installed, the cshell might not know where to
find the new package. Rehash wakes up the cshell and updates
it's cache to find things. Rehash is the trick to tell the
cshell to go out and learn how to find things again.
