Use `xhost +` to tell this display that it's okay for a
process running on a remote host to write to my local display. Note
that the first login did not work because suncs9 does not know my
made-up hostname "greg-pc". On the second attempt, it recognizes my
DHCP assigned hostname "dhcp5132.procket". Then, Enter "echo $DISPLAY"
to check if my display environment variable is correct. Use this echo
command to see if my display variable will propogate all on its own
for when I enter the "rlogin" command. It's supposed to propogate, but
it does not always do it. If it didn't propogate, we would either set
the display environment variable or give a display parameter
ourselves when we start it up, which is usually "-d". If I don't him a
display name on his parameter line, then he's supposed to read the
environment variable. The environment variable gets derrived from the
hostname that I inherit from the network.

Note: I could enter just "xhost +", but then everyone can write to my
display. In most environments, that's not very smart. However, some
people do it.
