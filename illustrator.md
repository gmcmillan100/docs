              ================

To make the granularity go away, save the illo as:

   Version 10
   tiff (8 bit color)
   Transparency
   include doc thumbnails and fonts (otherwise, the .eps won't
   remember and the fonts will get substituted upon viewing)
   CMYK postscript
   Level 2


characters		  Arial, 9pt size, regular

ctrl -/+                  zoom in/out

snap to point		  Always work with it. It is free flowing,
			  meaning when I grab a point and move it to
			  another point, they will snap together. 
			  Rarely is it a problem.

white arrow               Work primarily with the white arrow (not black one)

			  Grabs a line or point:
 
			    Blue dot = object moves
			    White dot = object reshapes
			  
			  Single or double click the object. Hold
			  Shift and grab the white dot to resize a
			  line proportionally. 

                          The + sign appears while pressing the alt
                          key. The + signs means it'll grab
                          everything. 


draw a box around image	  Group select. To deselect portions of the
			  object, unclick different blue lines.

ctrl [			  Send to back

ctrl ]			  Send to front

ctrl t			  Text properties box. Font changes.

ctrl j			  joins to lines (good for arrow heads)

ctrl i			  Line Thickness properties box

ctrl z			  Undo 

ctrl d			  Duplicates the last operation on a newly
			  selected object. Ex: Apply the same rotation
			  angle on a new entity.


stroke tool		  Create a dashed line. Select the line to
			  convert into a dashed line. Choose
			  Window:Stroke:Show options. Then check
			  "Dashed Line" and specify a point size. 

scale tool		  Draw a box around everthink that is to be
			  scaled. Then select the scale too. The next
			  click is the point where
			  the object will head to. Shift will keep the
			  object in proportion as you resize it.

			  For precise resizing, hit Enter after the
			  first point. The Scale dialog box appears. 
			  Enter the scale percentage.

			  Beware. Rescaling character text auto
			  changes the point size. For example, 9pt
			  might now become 9.72. To fix it, globally
			  select all text, hit ctrl t, select the new
			  point size. 

alt			  + sign. Means power key. Pressing alt while
			  you select an object will make a copy of it. 

			  To move an object, press alt during select,
			  but let go of alt while moving the object in
			  transit. 

shift			  Keeps things in proportion. A good habit to
			  use, especially in combination with the alt key. 

rotate tool		  It's a 2-step process. Select object, then click the rotate
			  too. Your next point will be the rotation
			  point at which the object revolves. 

			  Trick. Pressing alt during the second point
			  brings up the Angle Rotation dialog
			  box. Selecting "copy" will copy the element
			  instead of moving it. 

shear tool		  To get any arror to be at the right angle. 
			  Skews and rotates object on an axis to look just
			  right. It's for tricky touch up.


lining things up	  Two ways to go:

			  1) 
			  Copy an existing line that matches the angle
			  I want. Scale up and extend the line, so it
			  can be used as an edge guideline (to be
			  deleted later on). 

			  2)
			  Draw an edge line with the pen tool. Select
			  the tool. The first point/click is the start
			  of the line. The next point is the tail-end
			  of the line. See "locking".

			  Tip: Maintain a scrap file containing
			  guiding lines at the perfect angle: 45s,
			  90s, 33s, ...


locking			  Select an object then press ctrl 2. Now I
			  cannot select the object. Advantage: now I
			  can select and stretch up/down some of the
			  objects (no all). 

			  ctrl alt 2 unlocks all the locked objects.

			  Tip: Sometimes an object seems to not be
			  selectable. In reality, it is being
			  selected. Verify View:Show Edges is
			  enabled. 


curved lines		  Best way to draw is with elipses. Select
                          elipse tool, draw elipse, select scissors
                          tool, click point on one line side of
                          elipse, click second point on elipse, select
                          black arrow, draw box around unwanted half
                          of elipse, delete.

arrow keys		  Use to nudge an object in a specific
			  direction. Need to first select the object.

arrow heads		  Two ways to go:

			  1)
			  Draw manually. Create 3 points with pen
			  tool. To vertically allign, select the
			  2 endpoints with white arrow and press "ctrl
			  alt j". Average dialog box appears. Then
			  vertically allign. Next, select all with
			  white arrow. Choose Reflect Tool and click
			  the center point at which to reflect
			  on. Then fold over the 3 points while
			  pressing Shift (keeps proportion) and alt
			  (makes a copy). Next, "ctrl j" the points of
			  intersection to join both halves
			  together. Fill the arrow head with
			  black. Then, use the shear tool to adjust
			  the arrow head to the correct angle. Then,
			  use scale tool to resize the arrow tool.

			  2)
			  Select the line, go to Effect:Stylize:Add
			  arrow heads.

color    		  Select object with black arrow. Go to color
                          dialog box. To change the outline color of
                          object, click on the black square with a
                          small square inside it, now pointer changes
                          to eye dropper, select a color. To change
                          the fill color of object, click the solid
                          box above the other box.

line angles		  30 and 60 are the common isometric (ISO)
                          line angles. Most artists work in this
                          format. Object/Transform/Rotate/30 (or 60)


weird shapes		  Experiment with the path finder: Window/Pathfinder
