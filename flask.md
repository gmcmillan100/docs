Flask is a web framework for Python. It provides functionality for building web applications, including managing HTTP requests and rendering templates. 

Flask is a back-end framework. It’s actually a micro-framework so won’t find things like form validation or a database abstraction layer. Django is the way to go for a more complete framework.

The Flask server binds to port 5000 by default.

[Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) is a micro web framework powered by Python.
